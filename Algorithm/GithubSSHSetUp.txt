Checking for existing SSH keys

1. Open Terminal.

2. Enter ls -al ~/.ssh to see if existing SSH keys are present:

```
$ ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
```

3.
Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key.
By default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

id_rsa.pub
id_ecdsa.pub
id_ed25519.pub


Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent

1. Start the ssh-agent in the background.

$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566

2.First, check to see if your ~/.ssh/config file exists in the default location.

$ open ~/.ssh/config
> The file /Users/you/.ssh/config does not exist.

3. If the file doesn't exist, create the file.

$ touch ~/.ssh/config

4. Open your ~/.ssh/config file, then modify the file, replacing ~/.ssh/id_rsa if you are not using the default location and name for your id_rsa key.

Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa



Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain.
If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name,
replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.

$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa


Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard.

If your SSH key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.

$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard
